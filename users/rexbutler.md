I'm a web developer transitioning to Ruby, excited about broadening my skill set.

I love math (MS U. of Utah), chess, books and the wonderful feeling of getting technology to work.

I am 'rexbuter' on twitter, github, and gmail.

Most importantly, I'm looking for work. Search for me on dice.com and monster.com.
